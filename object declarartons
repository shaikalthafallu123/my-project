the have three ways to declaring javascript variable:

  *var
  *let
  *const

   1: var:-variable in javascript are container which hold reusable date.they are like cups filled with stuff,
   and this stuff can be used over and over again dependingon whichever way we choose.

   key words: var x;
              var y;
              var z; 
   2:let:-inshort it helpsus by makes it eaiser to see where variables lives in our code.

    key words: let x=20;
               let x=50;3
3:const:-when ou are sure a variable will not be reduced.

     const x=20;
     const y='boy';
     const z='developer';



   function declaration:
            
 A function declaration is a statement containing a funtion prototype (function name,return type, the type
  of parameters and their order).a if the funtion prototype is also followed by a brace-enclosed body,which generatres storage in the code space.
 
  function expression :
  
  a javascript function can also be defined using an epression .a function expression can be stored in a 
   variable.
          
           var x= function (a,b) {return a*b};
           after function expressionhas been stored in a variable the variable can be used as a function.
